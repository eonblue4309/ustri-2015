        <h2>What Is Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu?</h2>

        <p>Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu is a military art (bugei) that was introduced in the Tensho period (1573-1591) by its founder, Tamiya Heibei Narimasa. Narimasa, together with Katayama Hoki no kami Hisayasu (the founder of Hoki Ryu) and Sekiguchi Jushin (the founder of Sekiguchi Ryu) were pupiles of Hayashizake Jinsuke Shigenobu, the founder of iaijutsu.</p>

        <p>The style characteristics of the Tamiya school of swordsmenship are: First volume (Omote no maki) containing evelen kata and Second volume (Koran no maki) containing fourteen kata. Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu is a sword art that is distinguished by its emphasis on practicing basic techniques (kihon). In other words, to property learn kata means studying in great detail how to cut using the scabbard opening (sayaguchi) and how to use the scabbard hand (sayate). As a serious course of study, learning Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu involves having a clear understanding of the laws known as "Tamiya Nobility" and "Tamiya Purity."</p>

        <p>Iaijutsu is a martial art (bujutsu) that strives to supress a sudden attack by the attacker (teki) against the defender (aite) using a single, swift stroke of the sword. Iaijutsu assumes that every attacker uses a Japanese long sword (Nihontou) and seeks to master the various principles of drawing and re-sheathing the sword, attack, defense, etc.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, iaijutsu is a martial way (budo) based on the doctrines of Buddhism. As it is said, "The sword and Zen act in unison." Iaijutsu practices its techniques with a humble and modest heart and continually trains the spirit.</p>
